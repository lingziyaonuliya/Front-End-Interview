1.CSS selectors and their priority
| selector | format | priority weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id selector | #id | 100 |
| class selector | #className | 10 |
| attribute selector | a[ref=“eee”] | 10 |
| pseudo-class selector | li:last-child | 10 |
| label selector | div | 1 |
| pseudo-element selector | p:after | 1 |
| sub selector | ul>li | 0 |
| offspring selector | li p | 0 |What
ps: 
!important declaration has the highest priority.
If the priority is the same, the last appear style takes the effect.
When the sources of the style sheet are different, the order of the priority is: inline style > internal style > external style > browser user-defined style > browser default style

2.The attribute value of display and its function
| attribute value | function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none | element is not displayed and is removed from document flow |
| block | The default width is the width of the parent element, and the width and height can be set to wrap the line display |
| inline | The default width is the content width, and the width and height cannot be set |
| inline-block | The default width is the content width, and the width and height can be set to display it together |
| table | The element is displayed as a block-level table |
| list-item | Display like a block type element and add a style list marker |

block: will monopolize one line, multiple elements will start another line, width, height, padding and margin attributes can be set.
inline: element won't monopolize a single line, width, height setting is valid, margin, padding can noly be set in horizontal direction.
inline-block: set the object to an inline object, but the content of the object are presented as block objects, and the subsequent inline objects will be arranged in the same line.

3.What are the ways to hide elements?
display: none: The render tree won't render this object, so it doesn't occupy the place of the page and does not response to the bound listening event.
visiblity: none: element still occupies space in the page, but does not response to the bound listening evet.
opacity: 0: The transparency of the element is 0. But the element still occupies space in the page, and is able to response to the bound listening event.
z-index: negative value: make other element cover this element to hide it.
transform: scale(0, 0): Scale the element to 0 to hide the element.The element still occupies the a place in the page, but doesn't response to the bound listening event.
position: absolute: Hide elements by using absolute positioning to remove elements from the viewing area.

4.Explain the box model
There are two types of box models in css3: standard box model and IE box model
The box model is composed of four parts: margin, padding, border, content
The difference between the standard box model and IE box model is when we set the width and height , the corresponding ranges are different:
The range of width and height attributes of the standard box model only contains content.
The range of width and height attributes of the IE box model includes border, padding and content.
Change the box model of an element by modifying the element's box-sizing property:
box-sizing: content-box: represents the standard box model (by default)
box-sizing: border-box: represents the IE box model

5.What's are the features in CSS3?
added various of css selectors
border-radius
multi-column layout
Shadoweflect
text-shadow
text-decoration
linear-gradient
transform
rotation, zoom, positioning, tilt, animation

6.Single and multi-line text overflow hidden 
single-line text overflows:
```javascript
overflow: hidden;
text-overflow: ellipsis;
white-space: nowrap;
```
multi-line text overflows:
```javascript
overflow: hidden;
text-overflow: ellipsis;
display:-webkit-box;         
-webkit-box-orient:vertical;
-webkit-line-clamp:3;
```

7.How to implement a horizontal and vertical centering layout
absolute position: 
```
.parent {
    position: relative;
}
 
.child {
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
}
```
set the value of four directions to 0, and set the margin to auto. Suitable for boxes have width and height.
```
.parent {
    position: relative;
}
 
.child {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    margin: auto;
}
```
flex layout
```
.parent {
    display: flex;
    justify-content:center;
    align-items:center;
}
```

8.Understanding of flex layout and the use cases
Flex layout is a new layout method in CSS3 that makes an element a flex container by setting the display property value to flex, and all its children elments becomes its projects.
The following 6properties are set on the container:
flex-diection: attribute detemines the direction of the spinle
flex-wrap: attribute defines how to wrap lines if one axis cannot be lined up
flex-flow: a shorthand attribute of flex-direction and flex-wrap, default value is row nowrap.
justify-content: attribute detemines how the item is aligned on the spindle.
align-items: property defines how items are aligned on the intersection axis.
align-content: property defines the alignment of multiple axes.If the project has only one axis, this property dosen't work.
The following 6 properties are set on the project:
order: defines the order in which items are arranged.
flex-grow: defines the scale of the project, default value is 0, even there is space to left, it is not enlarged.
flex-shrink: defines the scale of the project, default value is 1, even if there is not enough space, the project will be scaled down.
flex-basis: defines the spindle space occupied by the project before allocating excess space. Default value is auto.
flex-grow: is short for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis, with a default value of 0 1 auto.
align-slef: allows a single item have a different alignment than other items, and can override the align-item attribute.Default value is auto.

9.Why do we need clear floats? How to clear floats?
Floating: in non-IE browser, when the container is not heighted and the sub-elements are floating, the container height cannot be stretched by the content. In this case, the content will overflow outside the container and effect layout.This phenomenon is called floating(overflow)
Floating elements are out of the document flow and do not take up sapce(causing 'height collapse')
A floating element rests when it touches the border containing it or the another floating element.

Problems caused by floating elements?
The height of the parent element cannot be stretched apart, affecting elements of the same level as the parent element
Non-floating elements of the same level as floating elements will follow.
If the floating element is not the first element, the element before the element will alse float, otherwise it will affect the display structure o fthe page.

Ways to clear the float:
Define the height attribute for the parent div.
Add an empty div tag after the last floating element, and add the clear: both style.
Parent tags containing floating elements are added to overflow: hidden or overflow: auto
