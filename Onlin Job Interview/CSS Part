ps:

If the priority is the same, the last appear style takes the effect.
When the sources of the style sheet are different, the order of the priority is: inline style > internal style > external style > browser user-defined style > browser default style

| attribute value | function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none | element is not displayed and is removed from document flow |
| block | The default width is the width of the parent element, and the width and height can be set to wrap the line display |
| inline | The default width is the content width, and the width and height cannot be set |
| inline-block | The default width is the content width, and the width and height can be set to display it together |
| table | The element is displayed as a block-level table |
| list-item | Display like a block type element and add a style list marker |

block: will monopolize one line, multiple elements will start another line, width, height, padding and margin attributes can be set.
inline: element won't monopolize a single line, width, height setting is valid, margin, padding can noly be set in horizontal direction.
inline-block: set the object to an inline object, but the content of the object are presented as block objects, and the subsequent inline objects will be arranged in the same line.

3.What are the ways to hide elements?
display: none: The render tree won't render this object, so it doesn't occupy the place of the page and does not response to the bound listening event.
visiblity: none: element still occupies space in the page, but does not response to the bound listening evet.
opacity: 0: The transparency of the element is 0. But the element still occupies space in the page, and is able to response to the bound listening event.
z-index: negative value: make other element cover this element to hide it.
transform: scale(0, 0): Scale the element to 0 to hide the element.The element still occupies the a place in the page, but doesn't response to the bound listening event.

4.Explain the box model
There are two types of box models in css3: standard box model and IE box model
The box model is composed of four parts: margin, padding, border, content
The difference between the standard box model and IE box model is when we set the width and height , the corresponding ranges are different:
The range of width and height attributes of the standard box model only contains content.
The range of width and height attributes of the IE box model includes border, padding and content.
Change the box model of an element by modifying the element's box-sizing property:
box-sizing: content-box: represents the standard box model (by default)
box-sizing: border-box: represents the IE box model
