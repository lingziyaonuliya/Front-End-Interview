##### What is front end routine and why is it essential for spa?

**Front-end routing** (also known as client-side routing) is a technique used in modern web development where the browser—not the server—controls what content is displayed when a user navigates to a new URL.

A Single Page Application (SPA) literally has only one HTML file (usually `index.html`). Without front-end routing, an SPA would be stuck on one URL, or it would break standard browser behaviors.

##### What is the difference between Hash Mode and History Mode?

The main difference between hash mode and history mode is how the URL looks and how the routing is handled under the hood.

Hash mode: uses the hash symbol (#) in the url. It works by listening for the `hashChange` event. The browser naturally ignores everything after the hash when sending requests to the server, Since the hash mode urls are not sent to the server, no special server configurationtion is required.

History mode: on the other hand, uses the HTML 5 history API to create a "clean" standard url path. When routes switched, history mode calls pushState() or replaceState to add or replace a route info into the browser history stack. So users can manage navigation without reloading the page.

To sum up, history mode uses real urls paths, which has better SEO but requires server configuration support.Hash mode uses hash to simulate routing, offering better compstibility and eliminating the need for server configuration.There is no better one, choose them depends on your actual needs.

#####  How the History API Works (pushState & replaceState)

The History API allows JavaScript to manipulate the browser's session history stack without triggering a page reload.

When the route changes, the router uses `pushState()` to add a new entry to the browser's history stack, or `replaceState()` to modify the current entry.

This allows users to use the browser's **Back** and **Forward** buttons seamlessly. Crucially, these methods update the URL **without** triggering a page reload or sending a real HTTP request to the server.

#####  How do you pass parameters between roots?

- Dynamic route params: define a placeholder in the router configuration, usually with a colon.

`/user/:id`

- Query parameters: add key-value pairs at the end of the URL after a question mark.do not require changing the route configuration.

`/search?keyword=value&sort=desc`

Route state: pass complex objects through the router's history state without showing them in the URL

`router.push({ path: '/detail', state: { userData } })`

##### what is batching in the context of Api requests?

**Batching** means combining multiple small requests into **one single network call**.

##### Talk about the difference between Minification and Obfuscation

Minification is mainly about performance.It removes comments, spaces, and breaks to make teh file size smaller.

Obfuscation is mainly about security and code protection.It transforms the code so that is hard for others to read or reverse-engineer.

In my workflow, I use webpack for minification.Webpack uses the TerserPlugin for minification, Vite uses esbulid,which is faster.

##### Does obfuscation affect performance?

Yes, Heavy obfuscation adds dummy code, increasing the bundle size. The browse needs more time to parse the messy AST.

As modern JS engines try to otimize code.Obfuscation makes logic unpredictable, which prevents the engine from optimizing it, causing slower execution.

So, it;s recommended to heavily obfuscate the specific critical parts, not the entire UI library.

##### How Tree Shaking works?And how does it relate to magnification?

Tree Shaking is a technique we use to remove **dead code**.It analyzes the `import` and `export` statements in code to detect which modules are never used, and removes them from the final bundle.

It relates to minification because they share the same goal: **performance**. Usually, Tree Shaking happens first to remove the garbage, and then Minification happens to compress the rest.

##### Why do we sometimes break production code after minification? 

Here are 3 most common reasons why this happens:

1. Minifiers rename variables to save space.But if the code relies on the string name of the <u>variable</u>, it breaks.
2. Variable Mangling, so if the code relies on specific class name or function name, the minifier rename them to single letters, The breaks any logic that checks for the original name.
3. Side effects, after tree shaking, it may removes code that looked useless but was actually important.

##### Can you explain how a mini fair works internally?

A minifier works like a recycling plant, here  are 3 steps that minifier use internally:

1. it parses the original code into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
2. it runs Transformations on this tree, and applies Mangling and Compression to modify it
3. it generates the new code string from that optimized tree, printing it out as possible without spaces.
