1.The difference between 'src' and 'href'
Both are used to reference external resources:
src indicates a reference to a resource.It downloads and applys the resource it points to within the document, when the browser parses the element, it will pause the download and process of other resources, until the resource is loaded, compilered and executed. So js script is usually placed at the bottom of the page.
href represents a hypeetext reference. When the browser recognized the file it points to, it downloads the resources it downloads the resource in parallel and do not stop processing other resources.It is commonly uesed in a, link tags.

2. Understanding HTML Semantics
Semantic HTML refers to the practice of selecting tags that convey the meaning of the content rather than just its appearance.
Machine-friendly: It helps search engines understand the context and importance of content, which is conducive to better SEO.
Developer-friendly: Semantic tags improve code readability and make the structure clearer, leading to easier maintenance.
Accessibility: It assists screen readers and assistive technologies in navigating the page structure.
Common semantic tags: <header>, <nav>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>

3. The difference between defer and async in script tags
Both attributes allow the browser to download external scripts asynchronously without blocking the HTML parsing, but they differ in when they execute the script:
async: The script is downloaded in parallel with the HTML parsing. However, once the download is complete, HTML parsing pauses immediately to execute the script. Execution order is not guaranteed.
defer: The script is downloaded in parallel, but execution is deferred until the entire HTML document has been fully parsed. Scripts with defer execute in the order they appear in the document.
Default (No attribute): The browser stops HTML parsing immediately to download and execute the script before continuing.

4. Inline Elements vs. Block-level Elements
Inline Elements: These do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
Examples: <a>, <b>, <span>, <img>, <input>, <select>, <strong>
Block-level Elements: These start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretching to the left and right as far as possible).
Examples: <div>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <dl>, <dt>, <h1>–<h6>, <p>

5. Web Workers
A Web Worker is a mechanism for running JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main execution thread.
Purpose: It avoids blocking the main thread (UI thread), ensuring the page remains responsive to user interactions (like clicking or scrolling) even during heavy tasks.
Structure: It typically requires two files: the main script (UI logic) and the worker script (background logic).
Use Cases: Suitable for computationally intensive tasks such as:
Image processing
Data encryption/decryption
Handling complex sorting algorithms
Processing large datasets or files

Usually need two files: one for main thread and one for the worker.
Web worker is suitable for some compuationally intensive tasks, such as image processing, data encryption, dealing with a large number of network requests or downloading large files, etc.
