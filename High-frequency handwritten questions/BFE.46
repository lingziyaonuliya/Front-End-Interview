```javascript
function once(func) {
	// result is serve as the storage of the result of the function call
  // called used to indicate whether the function has been invoked
  let result, called = false;
  // return a new function 
  return function(...args) {
  	// if the function is not been called yet
    if(!called) {
      // call the passed func and store the result
      result = func.call(this, ...args)
      // change the flag to show that the function has been called
      called = true
